This was my first approach to a Shopify ecommerce site.  However, once I got started I found the CMS to be quite intuitive and easy to follow.  It was not long before I was in my happy place searching through the various templates, sections and snippets.

Having experience with Wordpress and WooCommerce in the past I started with a duplicate of the Debut theme and renamed it sports-test-site.  

Due to the nature of the task, I have populated the site with product images and content sourced from MandM Direct and google images.  The site is by no means complete and is for demonstration purposes only.

For the custom css, I created a separate file to keep custom code away from the theme code. Also where I have changed templates, snippet or block files I have created duplicate custom files.  

The site is very basis but I have changed some css, where I felt necessary.

The customisation to the feature collection on the home page is where I have the product images flip on hover in order to show the back of the product.  This is a quick and simple change to give potential customer an alternative view without having to click into the product.

I created an about page so the customer as read all about the company.  For this page I included a customised section to show the top brand logos.  

This was my first glipse at the templating language, Liquid.  Having had experience with Ruby and more recently with python and the Django framework, this was familiar and I felt comfortable in this environment.

To be able to work alongside other Shopify colleagues and enhance my knowledge of the Shopify CMS would be a great and exciting opportunity.
